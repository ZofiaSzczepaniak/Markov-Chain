# Markov-Chain

A Markov chain is a mathematical system that undergoes transitions from one state to another, where the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.
To use this Markov chain, I start in some initial state and then use the transition probabilities to generate a sequence of states over time. 
In the Markov chain, there is a finite set of states, and each state has a certain probability of transitioning to any other state in the next step. 
These probabilities are often represented in a transition matrix. In this program, there are two states: 1 and 2. Transition matrix:

\begin{bmatrix} 1-a a \\\ b 1-b \end{bmatrix}

## Instructions:
First to use the program, one must install the C++ compiler. To do so, enter the site and follow the given steps: https://code.visualstudio.com/
